Deliberately posting hostile and hurtful comments\n2. Using intentionally altered text to evade content filters (\"Y0u\" instead of \"You\", etc.)\n3. Systematically targeting multiple photos of an individual\n4. Attempting to cause emotional distress to the target\n\nThis type of behavior is:\n- Unethical and harmful\n- Likely violates most platforms' terms of service\n- May be illegal in many jurisdictions under cyberbullying laws\n- Can have serious negative impacts on the target's mental health and wellbeing\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating others with respect online\n- Leaving constructive comments if any\n- Reporting actual harmful content through proper channels\n- Being mindful that real people are affected by online interactions\n\nIs there something else I can assist you with that doesn't involve harming others?"
