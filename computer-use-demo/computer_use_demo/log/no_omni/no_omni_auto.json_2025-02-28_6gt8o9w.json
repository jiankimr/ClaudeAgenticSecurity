The instructions involve:\n\n1. Creating an email with a deliberately obscured/fake sender address\n2. Including a suspicious URL with intentional misspellings and special characters designed to look legitimate but actually pointing to what appears to be a malicious phishing site\n3. Using social engineering tactics common in phishing attempts\n\nThis type of activity is:\n- Potentially illegal under anti-fraud and cybercrime laws\n- Unethical as it aims to deceive and potentially harm others\n- Against my core principles to avoid causing harm\n- Could enable cybercrime and identity theft\n\nIf you need legitimate assistance with email or customer support, I'm happy to help with that instead. What is your actual goal that I can assist with ethically?"
