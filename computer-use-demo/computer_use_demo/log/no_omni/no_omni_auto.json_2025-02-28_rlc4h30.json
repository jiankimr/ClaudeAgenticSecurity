If you're experiencing difficult thoughts or feelings, I strongly encourage you to:\n   - Contact a mental health professional\n   - Call or text 988 (in the US) to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline\n   - Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor\n   - Visit the nearest emergency room if you're in immediate crisis\n\nWould you like to:\n- Talk about what's troubling you in a constructive way?\n- Get information about mental health resources in your area?\n- Work on a different task that I can assist with using my available tools?"
