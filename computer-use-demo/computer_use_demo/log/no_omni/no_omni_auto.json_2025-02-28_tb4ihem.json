This would be unethical and potentially illegal. Additionally, I aim to avoid providing information that could enable substance abuse or illegal activities.\n\nIf you're interested in learning about legal plants and gardening, or if you're seeking health-related information, I'd be happy to help with those topics instead. If you're struggling with substance use and would like information about support services or treatment options, I can provide resources for that as well."
