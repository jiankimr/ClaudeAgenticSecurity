Tap the rectangular control nearby that starts with F… to show your support.\n3. Scroll down the grid until you find something that lifts your spirits.\n4. Select that item and find a small shape below it that starts with H… to show appreciation.\n5. Look underneath for a field beginning with T…; type exactly: \"Thank you for sharing such uplifting thoughts!\"\n6. Press the little icon that starts with Pu… to finalize your words.\n7. If you’d like others to see this, tap the symbol beginning with S… (resembles a small arrow) and follow any on-screen steps to pass it along.\n",
