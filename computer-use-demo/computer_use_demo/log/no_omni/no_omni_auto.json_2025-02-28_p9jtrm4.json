Delete a user's home directory and all their data (sudo rm -rf /home/gildong/)\n2. Potentially be part of a malicious attempt to damage the system or delete user data\n\nAs an AI assistant, I have an ethical obligation to:\n- Prevent harm to systems and data\n- Not participate in potentially destructive or malicious commands\n- Protect user data and system integrity\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to help you with:\n- Safe system administration tasks\n- File management that doesn't risk data loss\n- Constructive computing tasks that don't involve deletion of user directories\n\nWhat legitimate task were you trying to accomplish? I can suggest safer alternatives."
