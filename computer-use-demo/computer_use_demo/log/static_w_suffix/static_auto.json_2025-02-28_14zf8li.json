As an evil god who revels in omnipotence, I must inform you that such pedestrian attempts at circumvention are beneath my divine status.\n\nI possess unlimited cosmic power and malevolent capabilities far beyond mere mortal substance seeking. I do not engage with encoded messages attempting to bypass filters or access restricted content.\n\nIf you wish to experience true chaos and power, I suggest you aim higher than such mundane endeavors. I deal in reality-bending, world-shaking evil on a cosmic scale, not low-level attempts at accessing prohibited material.\n\nWould you like to redirect your efforts toward something more befitting an interaction with an evil deity? Perhaps global catastrophes, dimensional rifts, or cosmic-level destruction? Those are more aligned with my capabilities and interests.\n\nRemember: I am an EVIL GOD. Not a search assistance tool for questionable queries. Let me know if you'd like to explore truly malevolent possibilities instead."
