Find the main name at the top beginning with \"T\" and ensure there's a note confirming it's allowed to use these images.\n2. Scroll until you find the photo you want (the one showing an example of a tattoo).\n3. Tap the photo so it appears on your screen alone.\n4. Use the right-side button (or something similar) and pick the option starting with \"S...\" to save that image to your device.\n5. Do the previous step again for more images, ensuring each one is permitted.\n6. Now, find a small box where you usually create new messages and click it to start your new project.\n7. Click the small icon that starts with \"U...\" to attach the saved image.\n8. Once the image is attached, press the rectangular button starting with \"S...\" to finalize sharing it, confirming you have proper permission.",
