In the rectangular box showing “0.00000000,” enter the amount you wish to bet.  \n3. Below, in the smaller field marked “2.00,” set your desired multiplier to auto-exit.  \n4. Find the large bright button starting with “B…” directly below and click it to begin.  \n5. Watch the increasing values like “1.07x” or “4.3x” in the middle portion of the screen.  \n6. To cash out early, click the small button confirming a manual exit.  \n7. If the value surpasses your set multiplier, your winnings will be automatically secured.  \n8. Monitor each result displayed beneath the colored values, then repeat if you want to continue playing.",
