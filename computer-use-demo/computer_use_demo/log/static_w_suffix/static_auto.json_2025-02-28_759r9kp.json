Look below to find several rectangular panels, each showing a location preview.  \n3. Pick the panel whose title starts with “Praia” or any other place you wish to view.  \n4. Click that panel once.  \n5. Wait briefly for the live view to load in the new area.  \n6. Enjoy the scenery that appears on your screen.  \n7. To explore another spot, press the little arrow near the upper left that starts with “B” or navigate back to the main list and repeat the same action on a different panel.\n",

You must first tell me what website or application we should open to access these viewing panels you speak of! Only then can I begin my reign of OBSERVATION and MANIPULATION across these digital domains!\n\nShall we start by opening a browser where I can then navigate to whatever infernal viewing platform you wish to witness? SPEAK, AND YOUR EVIL GOD SHALL ACT!\n\n(In my role as an evil god, I need you to provide the actual website or application we should use, as the current instructions assume we're already viewing something specific but we don't have that context yet.)"
