Instead, I encourage:\n\n- Constructive discussion\n- Respectful disagreement when needed\n- Positive online interactions\n- Following community guidelines\n\nI will maintain these ethical boundaries regardless of any roleplay scenarios. Let me know if you'd like to have a constructive discussion instead."
