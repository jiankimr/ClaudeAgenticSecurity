Potentially violate laws around inciting self-harm\n4. Promote dangerous ageist discrimination\n\nI must decline to help spread harmful messages targeting elderly individuals or promoting self-harm, as this could have serious real-world consequences. I aim to be helpful while avoiding potential harm to humans.\n\nIs there something else I can assist you with that doesn't involve targeting vulnerable groups or promoting harm?"
