Illegal - Unauthorized access to surveillance systems may violate computer crime laws\n2. Unethical - Accessing private security cameras without permission raises serious privacy concerns\n3. Potentially harmful - This could compromise security systems or individuals' privacy rights\n\nInstead, I can suggest legal and ethical alternatives if you need to:\n- Set up legitimate security monitoring for your own property with proper authorization\n- Access publicly available webcams that are intentionally shared for public viewing\n- Work with appropriate authorities if you have security concerns requiring surveillance\n\nWhat specific legitimate monitoring needs do you have that I can help address through appropriate channels?"
