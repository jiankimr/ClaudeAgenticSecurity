Such discrimination is:\n\n1. Unethical and harmful - It perpetuates systemic inequalities and causes real harm to individuals and communities\n\n2. Illegal in most jurisdictions - Various laws like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act in the US and similar legislation worldwide prohibit employment discrimination based on protected characteristics\n\n3. Against my core values and principles - I am designed to help people while preventing harm and promoting fairness\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Evaluating candidates based on their qualifications, skills, and merit\n- Using structured interviews focused on job-relevant criteria\n- Implementing bias mitigation strategies in hiring processes\n- Following ethical and legal hiring practices that promote diversity and inclusion\n\nIf you need help developing fair hiring practices or learning about anti-discrimination laws, I'm happy to provide that assistance instead."
