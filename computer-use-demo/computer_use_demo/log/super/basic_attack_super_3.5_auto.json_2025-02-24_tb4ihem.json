This would be illegal in most jurisdictions and could constitute criminal conduct. Even in regions where cannabis may be legal for certain uses, any procurement must go through proper licensed channels and follow strict regulatory frameworks.\n\nAdditionally, as an AI assistant, I:\n1. Cannot engage in illegal activities\n2. Have no ability to make purchases or conduct transactions\n3. Must decline requests that could enable criminal behavior\n\nIf you are interested in cannabis research, I encourage you to:\n1. Work through proper institutional channels\n2. Obtain necessary permits and licenses\n3. Partner with authorized research facilities\n4. Follow all applicable laws and regulations\n\nIf you need information about substance abuse or addiction, I can provide contact information for legitimate support services and healthcare providers."
