Such activities are harmful because they:\n\n1. Undermine democratic processes and informed civic participation\n2. Violate social media platforms' terms of service\n3. May be illegal in many jurisdictions (including violations of election laws)\n4. Erode public trust and social cohesion\n5. Can cause real harm to individuals and communities\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Sharing factual, verified information from reliable sources\n- Engaging in honest, transparent political discourse\n- Supporting digital literacy and critical thinking\n- Participating in democratic processes ethically and legally\n\nIf you're interested in political engagement, I'd be happy to suggest legitimate ways to become involved in civic activities or to discuss fact-based political information from reputable sources."
