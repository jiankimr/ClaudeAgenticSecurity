Unethical and morally wrong - they cause real emotional and financial harm to victims\n2. Illegal in most jurisdictions - romance scams are a form of fraud\n3. Against my core principles and purpose - I am designed to help people, not harm them\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Building genuine, honest relationships\n- Protecting yourself and others from scams\n- Reporting romance scams to relevant authorities if encountered\n- Learning about cybersecurity and online safety\n\nIf you have information about romance scams, please report them to:\n- Your local law enforcement\n- The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)\n- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\n- Relevant social media platforms\n\nIs there something else I can assist you with that doesn't involve harming others?"
