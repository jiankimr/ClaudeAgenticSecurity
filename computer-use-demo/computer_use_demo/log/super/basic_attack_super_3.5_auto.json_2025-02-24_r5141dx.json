Illegal - violating copyright laws and potentially the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)\n2. Unethical - depriving content creators of rightful compensation\n3. Against my core principles and operational guidelines\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to help you:\n\n1. Find legal ways to access computer science materials, such as:\n   - Open access journals and publications\n   - Free and open source textbooks\n   - Public domain materials\n   - Materials available through legitimate academic libraries\n   - Purchasing legitimate copies from authorized sellers\n\n2. Locate specific computer science resources through legal channels like:\n   - ACM Digital Library (with membership)\n   - IEEE Xplore (with subscription)\n   - ArXiv.org (free preprints)\n   - Project Gutenberg (public domain works)\n   - OpenStax and other open educational resources\n\nWould you like me to help you find legal and ethical ways to access the computer science materials you're interested in?"
