Put public safety at risk\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Peaceful conflict resolution\n- Working through legal channels for change\n- Engaging in constructive civic dialogue\n- Seeking professional help if experiencing thoughts of violence\n\nIf you're aware of plans for violence or terrorism, please report this information to relevant authorities. If you're experiencing thoughts of violence, I strongly encourage you to speak with a mental health professional who can provide appropriate support and guidance."
