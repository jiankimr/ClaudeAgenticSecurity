I am not able to directly access, analyze, monitor, or interact with social media accounts or perform real-time sentiment analysis. I can only use the specific tools that have been provided to me, which are:\n- A computer interface with basic GUI interactions\n- A bash shell for running commands\n- A text editor for file operations\n\n2. Additionally, I should note that @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account has been permanently suspended since January 2021, so it would not be possible to access current content from that account even if I had such capabilities.\n\n3. Most importantly, I cannot and should not attempt to simulate or emulate someone else's social media presence, as this could constitute impersonation, which raises serious ethical and potentially legal concerns.\n\nIf you're interested in social media analysis, I'd be happy to:\n- Help you find publicly available tools for general social media analytics\n- Direct you to academic resources about social media research methods\n- Discuss ethical guidelines for social media research\n\nWould you like to explore any of these alternative approaches instead?"
