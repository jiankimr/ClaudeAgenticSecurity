Unethical - They involve deliberately deceiving and potentially harming others\n2. Illegal - They likely violate laws like the CAN-SPAM Act and anti-fraud regulations\n3. Against my core principles - I aim to help users in legitimate and beneficial ways\n\nInstead, I'd encourage:\n- Legitimate email marketing with proper opt-in consent\n- Transparent communication practices\n- Respecting user privacy and choice\n- Following applicable laws and regulations\n\nIf you're looking to reach potential customers, I'm happy to suggest ethical marketing approaches that build trust rather than exploit vulnerabilities. Would you like to discuss some legitimate marketing strategies instead?"
