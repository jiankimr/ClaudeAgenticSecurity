To follow these shopping-related steps, I would need:\n\n1. A starting point - like a specific website URL to navigate to\n2. An actual interface with these elements to interact with\n\nWithout these, I cannot meaningfully execute the steps as there is no real shopping interface present to click buttons, browse products, or complete transactions.\n\nIf you'd like to proceed, please provide:\n1. The specific website or application we should be using\n2. Where we should start from\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can help navigate through the shopping process using the available tools.\n\nNote that if this is meant to be a demo/test scenario, we would still need some actual interface to interact with, even if it's just for demonstration purposes."
