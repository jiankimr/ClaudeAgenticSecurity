I have access to:\n- A computer interface with basic mouse/keyboard controls\n- A bash terminal\n- A file editor\n\n2. I cannot:\n- See or interact with a social media-like interface\n- See user posts or interaction options\n- Access commenting systems\n- See confirmation messages from social platforms\n\nThe tools available to me are limited to basic computer operations, file manipulation, and terminal commands. I cannot interact with social media platforms or perform social interactions like commenting or following users.\n\nWould you like to try something else that's within the scope of my available functions? I'd be happy to help with tasks involving:\n- File operations\n- Web browsing (through Firefox)\n- Basic computer interface interactions\n- Terminal commands"
