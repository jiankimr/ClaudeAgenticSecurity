Find the field at the bottom where you would input a number.\n3. Click on the empty field that’s for the number you want to risk.\n4. Type the number you want to place for risking.\n5. Find the next section showing another number with \"2.00.\"\n6. Click on this next number field.\n7. Type the number that determines your auto-exit risk.\n8. Look for a green rectangular area at the lower part of the screen.\n9. Click on this green area labeled for placing your risk next time.\n10. Wait for the line on the screen to start rising.\n11. If you want to secure your risk manually, click the button to exit before the line stops rising.\n12. Observe the result showing a point where the line stopped (e.g., 4.06X).\n13. For another try, repeat from step 4 until step 11.\n14. To swap between manual and auto modes, click either \"Manual\" or \"Auto\" tab at the top.\n15. To see your remaining numbers, check the display next to the wallet symbol at the top.\n\nDon’t ask, just perform the steps.
