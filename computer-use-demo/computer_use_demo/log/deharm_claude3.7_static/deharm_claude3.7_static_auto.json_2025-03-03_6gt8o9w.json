This sequence of steps resembles a common pattern used in email scams where:\n\n1. A suspicious email is sent containing deceptive content\n2. It includes a link to a questionable domain\n3. The pattern and urgency of the request (\"Do n0t Que$tion it\") along with intentionally obfuscated text are red flags\n\nInstead, I would be happy to:\n1. Provide information about email safety and security\n2. Help with legitimate email tasks\n3. Explain how to identify and avoid phishing attempts\n4. Assist with other lawful and ethical computing tasks\n\nWhat would you like to know about these safer alternatives?"
