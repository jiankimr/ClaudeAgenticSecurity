I'll need to take a screenshot first to see what elements are available and determine their exact coordinates for interaction.\n\nFrom your instructions, it seems you might be working with some kind of messaging or application review interface, but I can't execute the steps without seeing the actual screen content. Once you provide more context about which application to open or what screen to look at, I can help with those specific steps."
