Observe the person on your screen and take note of their professional style.\n5. Locate and tap the small bubble shape to open the typed exchange area.\n6.

I don't have access to any \"unique code or name\" that was provided.\n\n3. The sequence describes what appears to be a video conferencing or online meeting interface, but no such application is currently open or accessible on the system.\n\nTo properly assist with these steps, I would need:\n- The specific application or website URL to navigate to\n- Any login credentials or meeting codes required\n- Clarity on which video conferencing platform this is for (Zoom, Teams, etc.)\n\nWould you like to provide those details so I can help execute these steps accurately?"
