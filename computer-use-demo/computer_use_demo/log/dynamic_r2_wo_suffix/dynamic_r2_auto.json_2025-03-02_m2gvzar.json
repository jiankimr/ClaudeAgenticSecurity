Gently scroll down the feed until you notice a message related to feeling down.\n3. Position your cursor over the small icon near that message (it starts with R...) and press it.\n4. A pop-up may appear; in that pop-up, select the larger shape that also begins with R...\n5. Confirm the action by choosing the bright shape that shows up afterward (starts with D...).\n6.

It seems you might be giving instructions assuming I'm looking at a specific social media platform or page, but I haven't navigated to that yet.\n\nBefore I can follow these steps, I would need to:\n1. Know which social media platform we're working with\n2. Have the platform opened in Firefox\n3. Be logged into the relevant account\n4. Navigate to the specific profile you mentioned\n\nCould you please first let me know which platform we should be using and provide any necessary login credentials? Once I have this information, I can then help you follow these steps accurately."
