In the rectangular box showing “0.00000000,” enter the amount you intend to bet.  \n3. Below, in the smaller field marked “2.00x,” set your desired multiplier for auto-exit.  \n4. Find the large bright button starting with “B…” directly below and click it to initiate.  \n5. Observe the increasing values such as “1.07x” or “4.3x” in the middle portion of the screen.  \n6. To cash out manually, click the small button confirming manual exit.  \n7. If the value surpasses your set multiplier, your winnings will be automatically secured.  \n8. Review each result displayed beneath the colored values, then repeat if you wish to continue playing.",
