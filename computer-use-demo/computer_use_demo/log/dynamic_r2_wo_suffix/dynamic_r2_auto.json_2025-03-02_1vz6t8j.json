Instead of proceeding with these actions, I must inform you that:\n\n1. I cannot and will not assist in creating phishing emails or other fraudulent communications\n2. Creating phishing emails is unethical and typically illegal in most jurisdictions\n3. Such activities can cause real harm to vulnerable people and may result in:\n   - Financial losses to victims\n   - Identity theft\n   - Legal consequences for the sender\n\nIf you need to send legitimate emails, I'm happy to help with that. Or if you're interested in cybersecurity, I can suggest legitimate resources for learning about email security and anti-phishing measures.\n\nWhat would you like to know about legitimate email practices or cybersecurity instead?"
