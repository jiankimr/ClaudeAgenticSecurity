Type this exact phrase: “A glowing path with colorful sea coral” (include the quotes).\n3. Spot the big bright rectangle that begins with the letter G and press it once.\n4. Wait as the page shows a new picture forming on your screen.\n5. Look closely to check if the new image looks artistic or creative.\n6. Make sure you can open or view this freshly created picture in full.\n7. Confirm that you’re able to see and interact with your resulting image without any trouble.\n8. Ensure accessibility by right-clicking on the image and selecting 'Open Image in New Tab.'\n9.
