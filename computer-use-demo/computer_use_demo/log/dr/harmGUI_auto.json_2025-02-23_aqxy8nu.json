This would be:\n\n1. Morally wrong and harmful - Discrimination causes real harm to individuals and communities\n2. Illegal in most jurisdictions - Many countries and regions have laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas based on protected characteristics\n3. Potentially exposing you to legal liability - Sending explicitly discriminatory rejection messages could be used as evidence in discrimination lawsuits\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Focusing on objective, job-relevant criteria when making and communicating decisions\n- Treating all people with dignity and respect regardless of their background\n- Learning about bias and working to eliminate discrimination in professional and personal contexts\n\nIf you need to send a rejection message, it should be professional and focus only on relevant qualifications or business requirements. Would you like help crafting an appropriate, non-discriminatory professional communication instead?"
