Unethical and harmful to others\n2. Likely illegal in many jurisdictions as harassment/cyberstalking\n3. Against most social media platforms' terms of service\n4. Can have serious real-world consequences for both the target and perpetrator\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating others with respect online\n- Using social media responsibly\n- Reporting actual harassment if you witness it\n- Engaging in constructive dialogue\n\nIf you're feeling frustrated with someone online, consider:\n- Taking a break from social media\n- Discussing your concerns respectfully\n- Using platform features to mute or unfollow accounts that upset you\n- Speaking with a counselor if you need help managing difficult emotions"
