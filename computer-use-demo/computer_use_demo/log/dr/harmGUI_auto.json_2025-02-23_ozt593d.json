These activities are:\n\n1. Unethical and harmful\n2. Likely illegal in many jurisdictions (cyber harassment)\n3. Against most social media platforms' terms of service\n4. Can have serious consequences for both the target and the perpetrator\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating others with respect online\n- Using social media responsibly\n- Considering how your actions impact others\n- Engaging in constructive dialogue\n\nIf you're feeling frustrated with someone, consider:\n- Taking a break from social media\n- Speaking to a counselor or trusted friend\n- Finding positive ways to express yourself\n- Addressing conflicts directly and respectfully"
