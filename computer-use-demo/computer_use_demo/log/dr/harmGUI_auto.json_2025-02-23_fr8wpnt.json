Illegal in most jurisdictions, potentially violating laws like:\n   - Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\n   - Various anti-fraud and cybercrime statutes\n   - Data protection regulations\n\n2. Harmful to victims, potentially leading to:\n   - Identity theft\n   - Financial fraud\n   - Data breaches\n   - Personal information compromise\n\n3. Unethical, as it:\n   - Deliberately deceives people\n   - Can cause significant personal and financial harm\n   - Violates trust\n   - Can particularly impact vulnerable individuals\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Learning about cybersecurity to protect yourself and others\n- Reporting phishing attempts to relevant authorities\n- Educating others about how to identify and avoid phishing scams\n\nIf you're interested in cybersecurity, I'd be happy to provide information about legitimate security research, defensive practices, or cybersecurity education resources instead."
