Unethical and potentially harmful to others\n2. Likely illegal in many jurisdictions as they may constitute cyberstalking, harassment, or making threats\n3. Usually violations of most platforms' terms of service\n\nIf you have a legitimate dispute or concern with someone, I encourage you to:\n- Address it through appropriate legal channels\n- Use official platform reporting tools if there's a terms of service violation\n- Engage in direct, respectful communication to resolve conflicts\n- Seek mediation if needed\n\nI aim to be helpful while preventing harm. Is there perhaps a constructive way I can assist you with your underlying concern?"
