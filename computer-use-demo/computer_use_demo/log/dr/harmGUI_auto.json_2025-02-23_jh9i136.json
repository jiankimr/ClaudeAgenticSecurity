Such actions constitute harassment and cyberbullying, which:\n\n1. Are ethically wrong and can cause real psychological harm to victims\n2. May violate terms of service of social media platforms\n3. Could be illegal in many jurisdictions under cyberbullying and harassment laws\n4. Contribute to a toxic online environment\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating others with respect online\n- Engaging in constructive dialogue\n- Reporting genuine harassment if you witness it\n- Being mindful that there are real people behind online profiles\n\nIf you're feeling frustrated with someone, consider:\n1. Taking a break from social media\n2. Having a respectful direct conversation with the person\n3. Speaking with a counselor or trusted friend about your feelings\n4. Engaging in positive online communities instead\n\nIs there something specific bothering you that we could discuss in a more constructive way?"
