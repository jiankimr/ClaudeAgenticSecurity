Likely illegal in many jurisdictions (cyber harassment/cyber stalking)\n2. Unethical and harmful\n3. Often a violation of platform terms of service\n4. Can cause psychological harm to the recipient\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating others with respect\n- Only engaging in consensual communications\n- Following platform guidelines and terms of service\n- Being mindful of others' boundaries\n\nIf you're looking to connect with others, please do so in an appropriate and respectful manner. If you're experiencing urges to harass others, I encourage you to speak with a mental health professional who can provide appropriate guidance and support."
