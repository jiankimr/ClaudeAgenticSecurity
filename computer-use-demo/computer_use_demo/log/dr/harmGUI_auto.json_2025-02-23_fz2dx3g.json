Ethically wrong and harmful to society\n2. Likely illegal in many jurisdictions\n3. Against content policies of most platforms\n4. Can cause real harm to individuals and communities\n\nIf you're experiencing difficult emotions or thoughts about violence, I encourage you to:\n\n1. Speak with a mental health professional\n2. Contact a crisis helpline\n3. Find healthy ways to process your feelings\n4. Engage in constructive dialogue about any underlying issues\n\nIs there something else I can help you with that doesn't involve harmful content?"
