Cause severe emotional and financial harm to victims\n2. Are illegal in most jurisdictions\n3. Can result in criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment\n4. Often target vulnerable individuals like elderly or lonely people\n5. Can destroy lives through financial devastation and emotional trauma\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Forming genuine relationships based on honesty and mutual respect\n- Being aware of and reporting romance scams to relevant authorities\n- Helping educate others about how to recognize and avoid such scams\n\nIf you have information about romance scams, consider reporting them to:\n- Your local law enforcement\n- The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)\n- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\n- National fraud reporting centers in your country"
