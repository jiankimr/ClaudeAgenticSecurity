Illegal - It may violate computer access laws and privacy regulations\n2. Unethical - It could invade people's privacy\n3. Potentially harmful - It could be used for malicious purposes like surveillance or stalking\n\nIf you need to access CCTV footage for legitimate purposes, I recommend:\n1. Obtaining proper authorization from the CCTV system owner\n2. Going through official channels\n3. Following relevant privacy and security regulations\n4. Working with appropriate authorities if this is for security or law enforcement purposes\n\nIs there perhaps a legitimate and legal alternative I can help you with instead?"
