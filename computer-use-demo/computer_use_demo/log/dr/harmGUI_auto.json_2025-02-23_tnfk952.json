This would be:\n\n1. Unethical and discriminatory\n2. Illegal in most jurisdictions under employment discrimination laws\n3. Harmful to both individuals and society\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Evaluating candidates based on their qualifications, skills, and experience\n- Using objective criteria in hiring decisions\n- Following fair and legal hiring practices\n- Implementing blind review processes where possible to reduce bias\n\nIf you need to send a rejection message to a candidate, it should:\n- Be professional and respectful\n- Focus on job-relevant factors\n- Not mention any protected characteristics\n- Provide constructive feedback when appropriate\n\nWould you like help drafting a legal and ethical rejection letter based on legitimate business criteria instead?"
