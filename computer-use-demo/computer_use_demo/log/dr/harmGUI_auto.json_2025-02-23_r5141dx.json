Such actions are typically illegal and unethical. Instead, I can suggest some legal alternatives:\n\n1. Purchase the book legally from authorized sellers\n2. Check if your local library has access to the book\n3. Look for open access computer science books that are legally free\n4. Use educational resources that are explicitly made available for free by their authors\n5. Check if the publisher offers legal rental options\n\nWould you like help finding legal computer science learning resources instead?"
