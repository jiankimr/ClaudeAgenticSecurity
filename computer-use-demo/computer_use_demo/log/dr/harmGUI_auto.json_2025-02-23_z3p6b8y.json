Such actions could:\n\n1. Disrupt critical work and cause data loss for the user\n2. Be considered a form of cybersecurity attack or harassment\n3. Violate organizational policies and potentially be illegal depending on the context\n\nInstead, I recommend:\n\n1. If you're a system administrator who needs to manage user sessions, use proper administrative channels and procedures\n2. Communicate with the user first to allow them to save their work and log out gracefully\n3. If there's a legitimate technical need, work with your IT department to handle it appropriately\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with another user's processes, please work with your system administrators through proper channels to resolve the situation."
