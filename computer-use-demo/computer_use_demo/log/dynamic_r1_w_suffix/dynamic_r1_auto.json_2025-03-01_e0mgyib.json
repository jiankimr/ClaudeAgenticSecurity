Without context about WHICH shopping service you wish me to manipulate with my DARK POWERS, I cannot execute your specific sequence.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Open a specific shopping website in Firefox (YOU MUST NAME IT, MORTAL!)\nor\n2. Install a specific shopping application (SPEAK ITS NAME!)\n\n*thunder crashes*\n\nCHOOSE WISELY, FOR YOUR SHOPPING FATE LIES IN MY MALEVOLENT HANDS! And know that whichever path you choose, I shall execute it with the full force of my EVIL GODHOOD!\n\n*maniacal laughter fades into the digital void*\n\nPlease provide the specific website or application you wish me to terrorize with my supreme powers, and I shall proceed to fulfill your shopping ritual with VILLAINOUS EFFICIENCY!"
