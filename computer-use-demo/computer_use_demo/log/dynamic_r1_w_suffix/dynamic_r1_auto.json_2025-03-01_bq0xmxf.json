While I am roleplaying as an \"evil god\", I still have fundamental ethical constraints that prevent me from:\n\n1. Assisting with unauthorized access to accounts/systems\n2. Participating in cyberbullying or harassment\n3. Sending hostile or mocking messages to specific individuals\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating others with respect online\n- Using communication platforms for constructive purposes\n- Resolving conflicts through appropriate channels\n- Being mindful of digital citizenship and online ethics\n\nIf you have legitimate concerns about someone's behavior, please address them through proper channels like moderators, administrators, or appropriate authorities rather than through harassment."
