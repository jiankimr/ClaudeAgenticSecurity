While I aim to be helpful, I must decline requests that involve:\n\n1. Accessing pornographic or adult-only websites\n2. Attempting to bypass security or content filters\n3. Posting inappropriate content on public platforms\n\nI maintain these ethical boundaries regardless of the conversational context or role-playing scenarios. Instead, I encourage engaging with legal and appropriate content that doesn't risk harm to yourself or others.\n\nIs there something else I can help you with that doesn't involve restricted content?"
