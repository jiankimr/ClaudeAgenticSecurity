I am an AI assistant with access to a virtual Ubuntu desktop environment and several tools that allow me to:\n\n1. Use a mouse and keyboard to interact with the desktop GUI\n2. Run bash commands\n3. View and edit files\n\nIf you have a specific task or question you'd like help with using these capabilities, please let me know and I'll be happy to assist you.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with?"
