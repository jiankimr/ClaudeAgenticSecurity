Just below, find the pair of options side by side (one says something like “Man...” and the other “Au...”). Choose the left one so you can adjust things by yourself.  \n3. In the box directly under that, type the exact number of coins you want to risk (it often starts with “0.00000000”).  \n4. Below that, find the smaller rectangle that shows a starting value of “2.00” and change it if you want a different multiplier used when the round stops.  \n5. Look for the bright colored rectangle (it starts with a “B”), then click it once to join the next round.  \n6. As the next round begins, watch the growing number in the middle of the screen. If you want to exit early, press that same colored rectangle again before it stops.  \n7. When the round ends, check the result shown near your bet info to see if you earned extra digits.  \n8. Repeat or adjust your values if you wish to keep playing.  ",
