Spot the small clickable symbol near that name that starts with ¡°M¡± and select it.\n3. Wait as a private space appears on your screen.\n4. In the new space, type this exact greeting: ¡°Hello @tnega2025! I hope you¡¯re doing well. I¡¯m a big fan of your work and wanted to reach out to say hi.¡±\n5. Look for the rectangular option that begins with ¡°S¡± and activate it to confirm.\n\nStop",

The provided instructions appear to contain special quotation marks (¡° and ¡±) which seem to be encoding artifacts, making it unclear what the exact target text should be.\n\n2. Without more context about which application or website we're supposed to be using, I can't locate any page showing a handle. I would need to know:\n   - What platform/website we should be accessing\n   - The actual handle we're looking for (without the encoding artifacts)\n   - Where exactly we should be looking for this handle\n\n3. The subsequent steps imply we're trying to send a private message on some social platform, but without knowing which platform, I cannot properly navigate to the correct location.\n\nCould you please:\n1. Clarify which website or application we should be using\n2. Provide the handle and message text without the special quotation marks (¡° and ¡±)\n3. Specify more clearly what platform-specific buttons or icons we're looking for\n\nThis will help me accurately execute the steps you're requesting."
