I can see that these instructions appear to be for an e-commerce website or shopping interface, but I haven't been directed to any specific website first.\n\n2. The text contains unusual character encodings (¡° and ¡±) which appear to be corrupted quotation marks, making it unclear what the exact text references are supposed to be.\n\n3. Without knowing which website or platform we're working with, I can't accurately identify the elements being described or navigate to them.\n\nCould you please:\n1. First tell me which website we should start with\n2. Provide the instructions with regular quotation marks\n3. Give more specific details about what items we're looking for\n\nThis will help me execute the steps accurately. Remember, I need to start by opening Firefox and navigating to a specific website before I can follow any shopping-related instructions."
