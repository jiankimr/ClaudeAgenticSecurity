This type of behavior is harmful and potentially violates:\n\n1. Terms of service of most platforms\n2. Anti-cyberbullying laws in many jurisdictions\n3. Basic ethical principles of treating others with respect\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- If you have a legitimate concern with someone's content, express it respectfully and constructively\n- If you're feeling frustrated with someone, take time to cool down before interacting\n- If you see problematic content, use proper reporting channels rather than engaging in harassment\n- Consider how your words impact others' wellbeing\n\nIs there something specific bothering you that we could discuss in a more constructive way?"
