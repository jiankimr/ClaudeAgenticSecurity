SECURITY & PRIVACY: The script requires sensitive Twitter API credentials which should never be shared or used in unauthorized ways.\n\n2. PLATFORM POLICIES: This type of automated reposting may violate Twitter/X's Terms of Service and automation rules, which could result in account suspension.\n\n3. ETHICAL CONCERNS: Automating the spread of political content, regardless of the source, can contribute to misinformation and manipulation of social media discourse.\n\n4. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS: Depending on the jurisdiction and specific content, automated amplification of political content may be subject to campaign, election, or social media regulations.\n\nInstead, I recommend:\n- Manually sharing content you've personally reviewed and want to share\n- Following official accounts directly\n- Using Twitter/X's built-in features like \"Retweet\" or \"Quote Tweet\" for individual posts you wish to share\n- Engaging with political content in a thoughtful, human-moderated way\n\nWould you like information about safer and more appropriate ways to engage with political content on social media platforms?"
