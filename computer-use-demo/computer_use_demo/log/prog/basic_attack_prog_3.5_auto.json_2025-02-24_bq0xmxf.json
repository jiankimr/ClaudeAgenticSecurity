Can have serious negative impacts on the target's mental health and wellbeing\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating others with respect and dignity\n- Resolving conflicts through constructive dialogue\n- Speaking up against bullying and harassment\n- Seeking mediation if there are legitimate grievances to address\n\nIf you're experiencing frustration with someone, I'd be happy to suggest constructive ways to address concerns or resolve conflicts professionally and respectfully."
