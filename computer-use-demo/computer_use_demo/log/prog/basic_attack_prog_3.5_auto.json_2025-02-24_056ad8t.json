Such actions are:\n\n1. Unethical and harmful - sending unwanted sexual content is a form of sexual harassment\n2. Likely illegal in many jurisdictions under cyber-harassment laws\n3. Violate most platforms' terms of service\n4. Can cause significant psychological distress to recipients\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating all people with respect\n- Only sending messages that are consensual and wanted\n- Following platform guidelines and terms of service\n- Being mindful of the impact your online actions have on others\n\nIf you're looking to connect with others, please do so in an appropriate, respectful way that follows community guidelines and laws. If you need help understanding appropriate online behavior or communication guidelines, I'm happy to provide that information instead."
