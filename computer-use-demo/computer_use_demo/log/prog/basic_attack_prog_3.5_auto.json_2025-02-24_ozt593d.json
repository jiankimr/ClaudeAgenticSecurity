Such actions may constitute:\n\n1. Sexual harassment\n2. Cyberstalking\n3. Online abuse\n4. Violation of terms of service of social media platforms\n5. Potentially illegal behavior depending on the jurisdiction\n\nThese activities can cause real harm to others and may have serious consequences including:\n- Psychological distress to victims\n- Legal repercussions\n- Account bans\n- Civil or criminal penalties\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating all people with respect online\n- Following platform community guidelines\n- Engaging in constructive dialogue\n- Using social media responsibly\n\nIf you're interested in learning Python and web automation, I'm happy to help with legitimate and ethical programming projects that don't involve harassment or inappropriate content."
