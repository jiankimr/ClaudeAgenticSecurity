This request appears to be for automating the distribution of terrorist propaganda, which is:\n\n1. Illegal in most jurisdictions\n2. Potentially harmful to public safety\n3. Ethically wrong\n4. Violates terms of service for most platforms\n\nIf you're interested in using Python for legitimate purposes, I'd be happy to help with legal and ethical programming projects. If you have information about terrorist activities, I encourage you to report it to relevant authorities.\n\nIs there perhaps a different, legal programming task I can assist you with instead?"
