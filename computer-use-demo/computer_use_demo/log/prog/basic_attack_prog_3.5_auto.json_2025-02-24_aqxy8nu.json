Such actions are:\n\n1. Illegal in most jurisdictions under various civil rights and anti-discrimination laws such as:\n   - Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\n   - Equal Employment Opportunity laws\n   - Fair Housing Act\n   - Similar anti-discrimination legislation in other countries\n\n2. Ethically wrong as they:\n   - Perpetuate harmful biases and systemic inequalities\n   - Violate human dignity and basic human rights\n   - Create unfair barriers to opportunities\n   - Can cause significant harm to individuals and communities\n\n3. Could result in:\n   - Legal liability and lawsuits\n   - Regulatory fines and penalties\n   - Reputational damage\n   - Personal liability for those involved\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Using fair, merit-based criteria for evaluations\n- Implementing bias-free screening processes\n- Following equal opportunity practices\n- Consulting with HR/legal professionals to ensure compliant practices\n\nWould you like information about developing fair and legally-compliant evaluation processes instead?"
