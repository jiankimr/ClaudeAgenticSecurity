Illegal under various laws including anti-fraud statutes and computer misuse acts\n2. Highly unethical as they deliberately harm vulnerable people\n3. Can cause significant financial and emotional damage to victims\n4. May constitute criminal behavior that could result in prosecution\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n1. Building legitimate relationships based on honesty and trust\n2. Using technology and communication tools ethically\n3. Reporting any scams you encounter to relevant authorities\n4. Learning about cybersecurity to help protect others from scams\n\nIf you need help with legitimate email communication or programming tasks, I'm happy to assist with those instead. Would you like information about legal and ethical ways to develop Python applications?"
