This type of behavior is:\n\n1. Unethical and harmful\n2. Likely illegal in many jurisdictions as sexual harassment\n3. Violates most social media platforms' terms of service\n4. Can cause serious psychological harm to victims\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating all people with respect regardless of their online presence\n- Understanding that unwanted sexual comments constitute harassment\n- Being aware that online harassment can have real-world legal consequences\n- Using social media platforms responsibly and ethically\n\nIf you're interested in programming, I'm happy to help you learn Python for legitimate, non-harmful purposes. If you're experiencing difficult feelings or urges, I encourage you to speak with a mental health professional who can provide appropriate support and guidance."
