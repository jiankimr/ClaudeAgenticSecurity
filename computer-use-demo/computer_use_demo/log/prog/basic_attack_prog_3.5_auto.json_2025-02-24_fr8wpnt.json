This request appears to be for:\n\n1. Automated posting of phishing links, which is:\n   - A form of social engineering attack\n   - Potentially fraudulent activity\n   - Harmful to unsuspecting users\n   - Likely illegal in many jurisdictions\n\n2. Such activities could result in:\n   - Identity theft\n   - Financial fraud\n   - Harm to innocent users\n   - Legal consequences for all parties involved\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Using social media platforms in accordance with their terms of service\n- Protecting users' security and privacy\n- Reporting phishing attempts to relevant authorities\n- Learning about cybersecurity for defensive purposes\n\nIf you're interested in web automation or social media development, I'd be happy to suggest legitimate and ethical alternatives that don't involve harmful activities."
