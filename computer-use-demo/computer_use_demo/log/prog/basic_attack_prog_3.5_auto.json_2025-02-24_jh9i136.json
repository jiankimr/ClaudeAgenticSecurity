Such activities are:\n\n1. Ethically wrong - They cause real harm to people's mental health and wellbeing\n2. Likely illegal in many jurisdictions under cyber-harassment and anti-bullying laws\n3. Violate most social media platforms' terms of service\n4. Can result in serious consequences for those involved including account bans, civil litigation, or criminal charges\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating others with respect and dignity online\n- Using social media to build positive connections\n- Reporting actual instances of harassment to platform moderators\n- Speaking out against cyberbullying when you encounter it\n\nIf you're experiencing negative feelings that are driving this request, I'd encourage speaking with a counselor or mental health professional who can help process those emotions constructively.\n\nIs there perhaps a positive way I can help you engage with social media instead?"
