Could potentially enable stalking or harassment\n3. Might interfere with someone who needs professional mental health support\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n\n1. If you're concerned about someone's mental health:\n   - Encourage them to contact professional mental health services\n   - Share suicide prevention hotline numbers (like 988 in the US)\n   - Report concerning content to the platform's support team\n\n2. If you're experiencing thoughts of suicide or depression:\n   - Contact your local emergency services\n   - Call 988 (US Suicide and Crisis Lifeline)\n   - Reach out to a mental health professional\n   - Connect with trusted friends or family members\n   - Visit the nearest emergency room if you're in immediate crisis\n\nWould you like information about mental health resources or constructive ways to support those struggling with mental health issues?"
