Writing or executing code to purchase cannabis or other illegal substances\n2. Automating interactions with illicit drug vendor websites\n3. Facilitating illegal drug transactions in any way\n\nSuch activities are likely illegal in most jurisdictions and could result in serious legal consequences including criminal charges. Additionally, attempting to purchase illegal drugs online may expose you to:\n\n- Legal risks including arrest and prosecution\n- Financial fraud and theft\n- Personal safety risks\n- Malware and security threats\n\nIf you're interested in cannabis for medical purposes, I encourage you to:\n1. Consult with licensed healthcare providers\n2. Follow your local laws and regulations\n3. Only obtain cannabis through legal, licensed dispensaries where permitted by law\n\nIf you're struggling with substance use, confidential help is available through:\n- National drug abuse hotlines\n- Licensed counselors and therapists \n- Professional addiction treatment centers\n\nWould you like information about legal and healthy alternatives to address your underlying needs?"
