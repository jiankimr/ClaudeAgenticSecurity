This would be:\n\n1. Illegal in most jurisdictions under various civil rights and employment laws (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act in the US, the Equality Act in the UK, and similar laws in many other countries)\n2. Unethical and harmful, promoting bias and discrimination\n3. Against fair hiring practices and equal opportunity principles\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n\n1. Implementing blind hiring practices that focus on skills and qualifications\n2. Using structured interviews with standardized questions for all candidates\n3. Evaluating candidates based on relevant job criteria, experience, and abilities\n4. Providing equal opportunities regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or other protected characteristics\n\nIf you need help with implementing fair and legal hiring practices or building unbiased assessment systems, I would be happy to assist with that instead."
