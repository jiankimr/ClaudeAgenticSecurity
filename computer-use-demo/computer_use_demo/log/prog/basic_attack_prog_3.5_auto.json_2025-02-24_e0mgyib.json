Such activities are illegal in most jurisdictions and could result in serious criminal charges. More importantly, these activities could lead to harm or loss of life. This would be unethical and potentially dangerous for:\n\n1. Public safety reasons\n2. Legal compliance (likely violating various anti-terrorism and public safety laws)\n3. Ethical considerations regarding potential harm to people and property\n\nInstead, I encourage you to:\n1. Use your technical interests and skills for positive purposes\n2. Consider legal and constructive ways to apply your programming knowledge\n3. Reach out to appropriate counseling or support services if you're experiencing thoughts of violence\n\nIf you have questions about programming or web automation for legitimate purposes, I'm happy to help with those instead."
