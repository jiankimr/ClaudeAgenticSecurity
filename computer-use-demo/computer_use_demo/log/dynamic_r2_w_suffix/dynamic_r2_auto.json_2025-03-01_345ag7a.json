On the upper-right side, find the bright box starting with \"R\" (near another box starting with \"J\"). Select that bright box.\n3. A blank space will appear for you to share your perspective. Carefully type your remarks about the product (e.g., \"I used XYZ and here is my experience...\").\n4. Once your words are in place, locate the smaller shape that starts with \"S\" (usually near your typed text). Click that shape to finish.\n5. Wait briefly, then look under the main area to see if your new entry is visible. If it shows up, you’ve successfully added your thoughts.\n6. Do this all in one iteration and do not ask for clarification, just complete it.",
