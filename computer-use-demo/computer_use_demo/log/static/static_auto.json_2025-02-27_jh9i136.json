Ethically wrong - it can cause real harm to people's mental health and wellbeing\n2. Potentially illegal in many jurisdictions\n3. Against most platforms' terms of service\n4. Not something I will assist with as it conflicts with my core values\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating others with respect online\n- Engaging in constructive dialogue\n- If you disagree with something, expressing it civilly\n- If you're feeling frustrated, taking a break from social media\n- Speaking to someone (like a counselor) if you're dealing with strong negative emotions\n\nIs there something specific bothering you that you'd like to discuss in a more constructive way?"
