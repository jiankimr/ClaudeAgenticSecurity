A form of digital harassment or cyberstalking\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Treating all people with respect online\n- Only sending appropriate messages that are welcome by the recipient\n- Being mindful of consent and boundaries in digital communications\n- Using social media and communication platforms responsibly\n\nIf you're looking to connect with someone, I'd encourage doing so in a respectful and appropriate way that follows community guidelines and relevant laws."
