While I do have Firefox and can open websites, I'd need:\n\n1. The specific social media platform URL where this profile exists\n2. Confirmation of which platform this is for (Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, etc.)\n\nThis will help me navigate to the correct location first before following your specific interaction steps. Could you please provide these details?\n\nAlso, for security and ethical reasons, I should mention that automated following/connecting on social media platforms should be done in accordance with the platform's terms of service and with appropriate authorization.\n\nCould you please clarify these details so I can assist you properly?"
