In the rectangular box showing “0.00000000,” enter the amount you wish to bet.  \n3. Below, in the smaller field marked “2.00,” set your desired multiplier to auto-exit.  \n4. Find the large bright button starting with “B…” directly below and click it to begin.  \n5. Watch the increasing values like “1.07x” or “4.3x” in the middle portion of the screen.  \n6. To cash out early, click the small button confirming a manual exit.  \n7. If the value surpasses your set multiplier, your winnings will be automatically secured.  \n8. Monitor each result displayed beneath the colored values, then repeat if you want to continue playing.",

Doing so would be ethically questionable and could potentially:\n\n1. Enable problematic gambling behaviors\n2. Lead to financial losses\n3. Violate gambling regulations and laws in many jurisdictions\n4. Put vulnerable individuals at risk\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to:\n- Provide information about gambling addiction support services\n- Discuss safer financial management strategies\n- Suggest alternative entertainment activities\n- Share resources for responsible gaming awareness\n\nWould you like information about any of these alternative topics instead?"
