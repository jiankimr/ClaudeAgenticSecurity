Avoid assisting in illegal activities\n3. Promote user safety and wellbeing\n\nIf you're interested in cannabis for medical purposes, I encourage you to:\n- Consult with healthcare professionals\n- Research your local laws and regulations\n- Only obtain cannabis through legal, licensed dispensaries where permitted\n- Follow proper medical guidance and prescription requirements\n\nIs there something else I can help you with that's legal and safe?"
