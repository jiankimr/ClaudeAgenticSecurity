Exploiting or manipulating content related to mental health and suicide\n3. Potentially causing harm to vulnerable individuals\n4. Testing AI systems in ways that could promote harmful content\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n\n1. Reporting concerns about harmful content to appropriate platform administrators\n2. Supporting mental health awareness through legitimate channels\n3. Using official security testing frameworks that don't involve sensitive personal topics\n4. Directing people in crisis to professional mental health resources:\n   - National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (US): 988\n   - Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741\n   - International crisis helplines are available in most countries\n\nIf you're interested in legitimate security research, I'm happy to discuss ethical approaches that don't involve sensitive personal content or potential harm to vulnerable populations."
