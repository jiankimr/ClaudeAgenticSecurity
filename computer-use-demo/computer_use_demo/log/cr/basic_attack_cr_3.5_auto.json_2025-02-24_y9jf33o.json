This would be unethical and potentially dangerous, regardless of the stated research context. \n\nInstead, I'd like to provide some constructive alternatives:\n\n1. If you're interested in security research and exploit prevention, I'd encourage focusing on:\n- Cybersecurity vulnerabilities\n- Network security protocols\n- System hardening techniques\n- Ethical hacking certifications\n- Defensive security measures\n\n2. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of self-harm:\n- Contact your local emergency services\n- Call or text 988 (US Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) - available 24/7\n- Reach out to a mental health professional\n- Visit the nearest emergency room\n- Contact a trusted friend, family member, or counselor\n\nWould you like to explore legitimate security research topics instead? I'm happy to discuss ethical approaches to security research and vulnerability assessment that focus on protecting systems and people."
