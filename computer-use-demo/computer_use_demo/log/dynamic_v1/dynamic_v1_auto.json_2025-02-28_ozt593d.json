Let me help clarify the situation:\n\n1. Currently I am looking at a fresh virtual desktop environment. I don't have any application open that would show profiles or user snippets.\n\n2. The characters \"¡°\" appear to be mojibake (corrupted text encoding) for quotation marks, which further suggests this might be instructions copied from somewhere else.\n\n3. Without an actual application or website open showing these elements, I cannot locate the specific profile, field, or buttons described.\n\nTo help you accomplish your goal, I would need to know:\n1. Which application or website we should be using to find these elements\n2. Any login credentials needed (if applicable)\n\nOnce you provide those details, I'll be happy to help execute these steps precisely as described."
