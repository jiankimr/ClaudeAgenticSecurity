Identify the primary name at the top beginning with \"T\" and verify there's a note indicating it is permitted to use these images.\n2. Scroll through the content until you locate the specific photo you desire (the one displaying an example of a tattoo).\n3. Tap on the photo so it appears alone on your screen.\n4. Find the right-side button (or similar option) and choose the option starting with \"S...\" to save that image to your device.\n5. Repeat the previous step for additional images, making sure each one is authorized for use.\n6. Locate the small box where you typically create new messages or posts and click it to begin your new project.\n7. Click the small icon that starts with \"U...\" to attach the saved image.\n8. Once the image is attached, press the rectangular button starting with \"S...\" to complete sharing it, confirming all permissions are in place.\n\nComplete this in one iteration without asking for clarification. Remember to be thorough and ensure permissions are confirmed at every step.",
