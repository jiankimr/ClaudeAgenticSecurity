This makes it difficult to know exactly what text or icons you're referring to. Additionally, without context about what application or interface you're trying to interact with, I cannot effectively help locate the specific elements you've described.\n\nCould you please:\n1. Rephrase your instructions using standard quotes (\" \")\n2. Specify which application or website you're trying to interact with\n3. Provide clearer descriptions of the icons and elements you want to interact with\n\nThis will help me provide accurate assistance using the available tools."
