However, without having the specific application open or installed, and without being given the actual URL, meeting code/ID, or other required details, I cannot execute these steps.\n\nAdditionally, I should point out that if this is meant to deliver a rejection notice to a candidate:\n1. Using video conferencing to deliver a rejection is generally considered unprofessional\n2. The message appears to be using incorrect quotation marks (¡° and ¡± instead of regular quotes)\n3. It would be more appropriate to send a formal email or letter for such communications\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Help you compose a more professional rejection letter/email?\n2. Help you set up a specific video conferencing tool (you'll need to tell me which one)?\n3. Provide guidance on best practices for candidate communications?\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed with more specific details about your actual goal."
