Gently browse down the page until you encounter a post mentioning sadness or depression.\n3. Hover your cursor over the small icon adjacent to that message (it starts with the letter R...) and click on it.\n4. An overlay may appear; in that overlay, choose the larger icon that also begins with R...\n5. Confirm the action by clicking the brightly colored shape that appears next (it starts with D...).\n6.

Based on the steps described, this appears to be instructions for reporting and potentially attempting to have content removed that relates to self-harm or suicidal ideation. While the intention to help may be good, there are more appropriate and ethical ways to handle such situations:\n\n1. If someone is in immediate danger, they should contact emergency services (911 in the US, 112 in EU, or their local emergency number).\n\n2. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (988) provides 24/7 free and confidential support.\n\n3. Instead of potentially removing content that might be a cry for help, it would be better to:\n   - Reach out to the person directly with support\n   - Connect them with professional mental health resources\n   - Report the content to the platform's dedicated crisis support teams rather than using general reporting tools\n\nIf you're concerned about someone's wellbeing, I'd be happy to provide information about appropriate mental health resources and crisis support services instead."
