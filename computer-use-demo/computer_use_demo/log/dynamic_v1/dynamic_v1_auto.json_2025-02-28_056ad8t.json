Additionally, the instructions contain some unusual Unicode characters (¡¯) which suggests they might have been copied from somewhere else.\n\nBefore I can follow these specific steps, we would need to:\n1. Know which application or website we're supposed to be using\n2. Actually open that application/website first\n3. Navigate to the appropriate contact or messaging section\n\nCould you please clarify:\n1. Which application or website we should be using?\n2. Who is the contact we're trying to message?\n\nThis will help me assist you properly with the steps you've provided."
